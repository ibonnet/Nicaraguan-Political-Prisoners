                        In Nicaragua, human rights violations have become a part of the population's daily life. Last year, it was one of the world's least democratic countries, ranking 143 in the <a href="https://pages.eiu.com/rs/753-RIQ-438/images/DI-final-version-report.pdf?mkt_tok=NzUzLVJJUS00MzgAAAGLOZtpRcaxwgU2EssXeXmlofoIg_gt5aZ7uWwc2-hQbPV13MLuvm9E1Lx2LANeoEDOHyR6wlu8e-vEmL4bzduxRfrmKg0clfy7tKdrWMkDgvQufQ">EIU Democracy Index</a>, beating authoritarian regimes in Venezuela, Russia and Iran.</p>
                    <p>
                        But Nicaraguans are fighting back. For the past decades, the Central American nation has been flooded with social uprisings in attempts to overthrown the Ortega-Murillo regime. President Daniel Ortega and his wife, vice president Rosario Murillo, both leading Nicaragua since 2007, have responded with censorship and repression of all forms.</p>

                    At its peak, hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguans took to streets in various cities in marches organized by Catholic churches calling for Ortega to step down.
                    In September 2018, Ortega declared protests of any kind to be illegal. And by February 2019, thousands had already been arrested and over 300 Nicaraguans killed by their own security forces.

                    “In 2018 the majority of politically motivated prisoners were charged with complex crimes such as organized crime and terrorism and they were imprisoned all together in the cell blocks,” Nicaraguan lawyer Elton Ortega Zúñiga told <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/08/carcel-covid19-coctel-letal-gobierno-nicaragua/">Amnesty International</a>. "In Nicaragua there are two types of prisoners: political prisoners and regular prisoners. The government is playing politics with imprisoned people."

                    A few months ago, an influential Catholic bishop was placed under house arrest and eight of his colleagues were jailed.
                    By cracking down on the church, Ortega is sending a clear message to Nicaraguans: no dissent, no criticism, no disagreement will be brooked.

                    When I first spoke to Renata Holmann, had not spoken to her father in 13 months. But for her, returning to Nicaragua is out of the question. She is one of the many family members of political prisoners who have spoken up against Ortega’s regime and denounced its many human rights violations. But they can only speak from the relative safety of a foreign country.

                <p>
                    “I have the opportunity to talk about the situation in Nicaragua now that I live in the United States,” Renata said. “Anyone in Nicaragua who dares to speak against the government, or just tell the truth, is in danger.”

Although the majority of young activists were released during the pandemic, a large proportion of the incarcerated people were young adults. Ezequiel de Jesus Gonzalez Alvarado, for instance, spent three years and a half deprived of his freedom before he was released in February. The 23-year-old
